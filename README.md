## Academic Papers:
* [Attention is All you Need (2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf): The paper that changed everything - introduces the Transformer architecture that completely revolutionaized generative AI and created the foundation for all of the modern popular AI applications.
* [Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models (2023)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903): A groundbreaking and somewhat scary discovery that complex reasoning can be drawn out of an LLM simply by using a prompting technique.  Contains demonstrations and techniques you can use in your own prompting.
* [Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners (2023)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11916): Demonstrates an even scarier discovery that reasoning behavior can be elicited from an LLM by simply adding specific phrases to a prompt with no additional context. Contains demonstrations and techniques you can us ein your own prompting.
